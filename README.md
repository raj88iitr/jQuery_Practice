jQuery_Practice
===============

This is ideally a private repository. However, I am a small time developer with full time work and cannot afford to pay for the monthly upgrade. Hence, this is a public repository.

Feel free to clone this repository but I will not accept any pull requests.

For the curious, I will be playing around with the tutorials located at jQuery.com

Wish me luck!
